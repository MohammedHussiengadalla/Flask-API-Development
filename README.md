Set up a SQLite database to store test cases and their execution results with appropriate
table schema.
2. Create endpoints for:
• Creating a new test case and storing it in the SQLite database
• Retrieving a list of all test cases from the SQLite database
• Retrieving a single test case by its ID from the SQLite database
• Updating an existing test case in the SQLite database
• Deleting a test case by its ID from the SQLite database
• Recording the execution result of a test case for a specific test
asset in the SQLite database
• Retrieving the execution results of all test cases for a specific test
asset from the SQLite database

3. Implement data validation and error handling for each endpoint.
4. Write unit tests to ensure the functionality of each endpoint.
